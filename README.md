### Hi there 👋, I'm Dhiyo
#### A Student Developer on a Journey

I’m a student at **TI Global Denpasar**, focused on building a solid foundation in web development with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. I’m passionate about coding and continually expanding my skills by working with front-end frameworks like **Tailwind** and **Bootstrap**. My **UI/UX design** background helps me create user-friendly interfaces, and I’m currently learning **React** for building scalable web apps. On the back-end, I’m exploring **PHP** and **Laravel** to strengthen my development capabilities. Looking forward, I’m excited to dive into **Data Science**, where I aim to combine coding with data analysis and machine learning to tackle complex problems and create impactful solutions.
